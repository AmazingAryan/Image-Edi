Greetings,

This is the project for task assigned in the given assignment to build an image editor.

For mobile view-> max width is 768px
    desktop view-> min width is 768px

Features: 
1. Crop
2. Zoom
3. Rotate
4. Flip
5. Clip images in shapes like heart, square, rectange and circle.

Dependencies:
+ Cropper.js library

Dev-note:
I have built this code purely using vanilla js as mentioned in the task and also used cropperjs for convinience.
The web-app could be a little bit sloppy and buggy at times in your device, if you find any bug, do let me know, I'll try to fix it.

Thanks for reviewing!
